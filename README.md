# Data Science events in Hamburg 

This is a repository that creates a list (or on the server, a dynamic website) of Data Science related (or otherwise relevant to the CDCS) seminars and talks in Hamburg. The list is created using web-scraping and API requests. More events are added as further events are identified.  

## Current events list 
[See here](/fetchevents/ds_events.md)

## Events are scraped from:

* Intelligent Process Control Seminar
    From website: "The IPC-seminar serves as information and exchange platform for scientific computing within the accelerator division. Target audience are scientists, engineer’s, postdocs, master and bachelor students working on data analysis & data mining, fault diagnosis & supervisory control or data-driven advance feedbacks using modern statistics, machine learning algorithm and artificial intelligence methods. The seminar should provide a low-threshold hub for presenting your results, to address challenges, and for disseminating knowledge on controls, computing, data-acquisition and software-structures relevant for your work. We also include tutorials on methods, advanced processing techniques, software frameworks & languages to leverage our scientific computing efforts toward autonomous and higher performance accelerators."

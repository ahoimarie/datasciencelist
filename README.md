### Intelligent Process Control Seminar
From website: "The IPC-seminar serves as information and exchange platform for scientific computing within the accelerator division. Target audience are scientists, engineer’s, postdocs, master and bachelor students working on data analysis & data mining, fault diagnosis & supervisory control or data-driven advance feedbacks using modern statistics, machine learning algorithm and artificial intelligence methods. The seminar should provide a low-threshold hub for presenting your results, to address challenges, and for disseminating knowledge on controls, computing, data-acquisition and software-structures relevant for your work. We also include tutorials on methods, advanced processing techniques, software frameworks & languages to leverage our scientific computing efforts toward autonomous and higher performance accelerators."

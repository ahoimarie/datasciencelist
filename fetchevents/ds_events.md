Among other things like content moderation andimage detection, one goal of our Data Science team is to find the bestcontent for every user. We are currently moving away from a strictly(reverse) chronological feed towards a more personalized feed. One corechallenge is to infer content preferences from hundreds of millions ofuser interactions every day.

We briefly review how ANNs in system design relate to faults -- as a potential weakness and for mitigation. We provide some details on an ANN design for fault detection. The goal of the presentation is to raise the awareness for dependability in the thought-to-be-naturally-resilient ANN paradigm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://indico.desy.de/event/29960/                                                                         |

Furthermore, the audience gives feedback to the speaker so that he/she can improve his/her way of presentation. This seminar is exceptionally from PhD students to PhD students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                             |

Furthermore, the audience gives feedback to the speaker so that he/she can improve his/her way of presentation. This seminar is exceptionally from PhD students to PhD students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                             |

| 2021-04-22 | 15:00  | When heavy ions meet cosmic rays : how the QGP could solve the muon puzzle?                                                      |                 | The deficit of muons in the simulation of extensive air showers is a long standing problem and the origin of large uncertainties in the reconstruction of the mass of the high energy primary cosmic rays. Hadronic interaction models re-tuned after early LHC data have a more consistent description of the muon content among them but still disagree with data.

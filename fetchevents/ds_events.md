The school addresses all physicists from the student to the senior level who feel that they would profit from lectures and hands-on exercises on the following topics: Going from C to C++, function overloading, default parameters, operatorsClass basics, namespaces, constructors, destructorsC++ style input/output operations (basics)Dynamic memory management, pointers using                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | https://indico.desy.de/event/41060/                                                                |
